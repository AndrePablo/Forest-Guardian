Our game is a platformer shooter game, where you venture through the woods encountering monsters
until you reach the person behind it all.

The game features 3 levels, in the first 2 you can explore the area and fight 3 different enemy 
types (two kinds of slimes and a bat). You have three weapons to use which each deal different
amounts of damage. You have infinite ammo for the pistol, and you can find ammo pickups for the 
rifle and shotgun to replenish some ammo. The dash is useful for getting away from enemies, and is
required to make some of the jumps for platforming. The third level is a bossfight, the boss will 
get stronger once you take him down to half health.
